# CROWN testing samples

The files in this repo are used during the testing of [CROWN](https://github.com/KIT-CMS/CROWN).

The files are self-generated NanoAOD samples, which can be produced with the open source [CMSSW](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw) framework. The following script generates a file from scratch using [fast simulation](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideFastSimulationExamples).

See the [documentation](https://crown.readthedocs.io/) for the details.
